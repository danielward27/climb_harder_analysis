### Introduction
Climbing has relatively recently picked up in popularity, being included for the first time in the Tokyo 2020 olympics. There is very little data on climbing habits of successful (and unsucessful) climbers, and training routines are generally heavily anecdotal. A reddit user, u/higiff, posted a survey on the "climb harder" subreddit (https://www.reddit.com/r/climbharder/comments/6693ua/climbharder_survey_results/), in order to question climbers about their training habits. This to my knowledge is the largest publically available dataset on climbers and their training strategies.

Having been climbing consistently for around four years now, I was intrigued to see what information this dataset might contain. Causal inference is unfortunately impossible with this dataset, but nevertheless, in the absence of better data, understanding the habits of highly effective climbers is still potentially useful.

Further to this, I wanted a chance to practice data analysis in Python using numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, in a situation that wasn't a "follow along" tutorial.
